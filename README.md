# **Work Day Scheduler Assignment**

## **Assignment Intention**
For this assignment:
* I was attempting to create an interactive work day scheduler.
* The user will be shown a blank 9-5 schedule that will allow them to input and save events on their day calendar to their local storage.
* The scheduler will show the current time and date at the top of the page, as well as respond to the time of day the user is accessing their calendar. The scheduler will color code respond to the time of day, white for past, red for present and green for future. 
* The user can save their events to local storage and access the site at another time to check their day planner.
