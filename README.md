# **Work Day Scheduler Assignment**

## **Assignment Intention**
For this assignment:
* I was attempting to create an interactive work day scheduler.
* The user will be shown a blank 9-5 schedule that will allow them to input and save events on their day calendar to their local storage.
* The scheduler will show the current date at the top, as well as respond to the time of day the user is accessing their calendar. The scheduler will color code respond to the time of day, white for past, red for present and green for future.
